# Episode #5 of 10 - Stop Studying English: Part 1

How are you feeling? I hope pretty goodâ€”especially because you've made it to the middle of the course now. Keep up the good work! You've done a lot in the past four days, and now is a good time to try something that might be new for you.

Today we are going to start to break an old habit that you might have: studying English. Yes, I want you to stop studying English.

Maybe you're thinking, "What? I thought this email course was all about studying English!"

Well, yes and no.

Let me try to be clearer: I do want you to keep "studying" English, but I also want to share some tips about studying English **by learning other things in English**.

Because the truth is, you will get bored and quit if all you ever do is "study" English. Because who wants to feel like THIS all the time?

Maybe you've even already "quit" studying English before. How many times have you "quit"? Once? Twice? More times than you can count? It's okay to admit it, because then you can start to look for new ways (besides just "studying") to make English a part of your life.

Language is for us to use; it's a tool to help us connect and communicate with other people. So let's use English that way!

Here's what you're going to do today. You are going to learn something about any topic you choose, but you are going to learn about it IN English from someone in a video teaching you something IN English.

Let's just do it and you can see what you think.

## Steps to take today:

**Step 1: Go to YouTube, Vimeo, or another video website if these websites are blocked in your country.**

The links are right here! So no excuses. :)

** Step 2: Search for something you want to learn about.**

It could be "best places to visit in Sydney, Australia" or "top English football teams" or "funny news stories." You can think of a topic related to your English goal (remember Lesson #1?), search for it IN English, then watch a video on the subject.

NOTE: One thing you SHOULDN'T DO is search for "how to improve your English." Try to learn something new in English today that's NOT about "learning English."

** Step 3: Write down another five topics that you would like to learn about**

Choose any topics that are not related to English grammar/English learning/English vocabulary, etc.

**Step 4 (BONUS STEP): Add new and interesting phrases to your vocabulary apps or English notebook**

Read and review your new phrases by saying them out loud for speaking practice.

Nice work! You just learned something interesting, and you did it in English! Now remember to learn something else through watching videos on a different topic (or one of the five topics you listed out) tomorrow. And then do it again the next day. And then do it again. :)

Tomorrow's lesson will help you keep learning in English using a different form of media. It's a really useful tip, so make sure to open up the next email.

See you tomorrow.
