# Episode #8 of 10 - Speaking More English in Real Life: Part 2

We all have lots of excuses (and some of them are actually pretty good!) that can keep us from speaking in English or talking to native speakers. Maybe you think or say things like this:

"Yeah, I know I need to speak more, BUT my whole family and all my friends are Russian too."

Or maybe…
"Yeah, I would like to speak more English, BUT I live in a small town in the middle of Spain."

Oh, here's a good one...
"Speaking? But I just can't find native speakers to talk to."

All of these excuses for not speaking more may very well be true for you.

But really, it's not like you are trying to learn Swedish (well, maybe you are trying to learn Swedish, but because you signed up for this email course, I know that you want to improve your English too). What I mean is, there are always people EVERYWHERE looking to speak more English.

And you are resourceful and looking for answers. I believe in you. You CAN find people to talk to in English.

Here is a list of some alternative ways you can talk to people in English (even if you live in a non-English-speaking country):

**1. Join or create your own English club.**

Many language schools have these types of clubs. You can also make your own. Get together with a couple co-workers or friends once a week and have an English-only lunchtime conversation.

**2. Go to tourist spots around town and talk to people there.**

In my hometown in California, we have a museum for John Steinbeck (a famous author). In the town I live in now, we have a pyramid. People come from all over the world to visit both of these places. Go to a place like that where you live.

See if you can overhear any couples or small groups of people talking in English (or even another foreign language!). Then ask the people if they want to have their picture taken. Ask them if they're enjoying their stay, where they're from, etc. Start a conversation—in English, of course!

**3. Join in on American or British cultural events.**

If there are two or more Americans/Canadians/Brits around town, they probably know each other. Talk to them. Find out if they are going to any cultural events (like a Thanksgiving dinner or English-only talks or classes). Go to the events too.

**4. Go to American or British bars, pubs, restaurants, and/or cafes.**

"Go where the fish are" is a saying we have in English. Try hanging out where people who speak English hang out. Be friendly and ask them how they're doing.

**5. Join an online class on a topic that interests you.**

If you seriously live in a ten-person town in the middle of China, you can use the internet to find events, classes, or workshops (in English) that take place online. Join them and just be like any of the other students. Join in on the chats and conversations. Try and make a friend in the course and talk over Skype about the course contents.

## Steps to take today:

**Step 1: Choose one of the "talking in English" alternatives from this list**

Only one step to take today. Just choose one of the alternatives from this list and make a note on your calendar or schedule to try it out. For example, you might not have time to go to the local "tourist spot" today, but make a plan on your calendar so you remember to go next Saturday or whenever you have time.

I'll repeat what I said earlier in this lesson:

You are resourceful and looking for answers. I believe in you. You CAN find people to speak with in English.

If you already decided to take this course and you really want to improve your English, I know you can find a way to put in the actual work and do it.

We also say in English, "Where there's a will, there's a way." If you are willing, you can find a way to do it.

See you tomorrow!
