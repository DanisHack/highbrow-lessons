# Episode #6 of 10 - Stop Studying English: Part 2

Today's lesson will help you take another action to stop studying English and start learning more IN English.

If you are still not convinced that you should at least spend part of your time NOT studying English, think about this:

If you are already at a low intermediate level or higher in English, it's time to start really using English and not just studying grammar rules.

...because maybe something like this has happened to you?

**You are having a conversation with someone in English, but you have to stop and think about all the “grammar rules” each time you go to speak.**

You are worried about 1st person vs. 3rd person (or is it 3rd person plural?) and wondering if you need to use simple past or past progressive…or is it past perfect?

You get so worried that you aren't using the right rules that **you don't even notice that the person you are talking to is already talking about something else** and has asked you TWO NEW questions! Aaaah!

Phew!

Okay, take a minute, just breathe, and read on for a different approach.

Let's take the focus off of too much grammar learning and study a different way: learning something, and learning it IN English.

My most successful students use a free resource to learn in English that you can try too:

**They learn things in English through listening to podcasts.**

Podcasts are similar to live radio shows, but you can download them and listen to the episodes anytime you want. Many episodes include interviews where two or more people have a conversation on a topic. Sometimes the episodes will just have one host who talks about different topics. Tak

## Steps to take today:

**Step 1: Choose a couple podcasts that will teach you something in English**

Go to the iTunes store ([you can download the program for free on your computer here](http://www.apple.com/itunes/)—just click the Download button on the top right-hand corner of the screen). Of if you have an iPhone or Mac, the program should already be on your device.

Once you open the program, type the following into the search box:

	[Interesting topic] + podcast

	For example: Happy relationships podcast

	or

	Best new tech podcasts

	or

	Healthy eating podcast

**Step 2: Upload a couple podcast episodes onto a device you can take with you**

Subscribe to a few podcast shows that seem interesting to you. Then put a few different episodes on your phone, iPad, iPod, or MP3 player. Or maybe you always have your laptop with you; use your laptop then. Choose the best device for you and your lifestyle

**Step 3: Find a time that works for you to listen to your chosen podcast episodes**

Some of my students like to listen to podcasts when they go for a run or work out at the gym. Other students find that they have time on their commute (on the train or while driving) to listen. You can also listen as you clean or cook. Try out different times during your daily routine and see what works for you.

You can listen to podcasts on English language learning, but I also recommend that you download podcasts on other topics. You can learn more about your industry (for work) or choose a topic you've always wanted to learn more about (history, psychology, personal development, whatever!). You definitely won't get bored if you choose interesting topics for YOU.

Keep up the good work! I'll see you tomorrow.
