# Episode #10 of 10 - New Love

Susan was eating the muffins and thinking about John. He was definitely a nice man! They had **hit it off** immediately, and they seemed to be **getting on like a house on fire**—although, truth be told, they had only known each other for a few minutes.

"John," she asked. "Do you believe in **love at first sight**?"

"Wh- what?" John almost choked on his muffin. The question took him completely by surprise.

"Oh, you know, **a match made in heaven** and that kind of stuff."

"Ah… well… I never really thought about that, to be honest." John seemed really embarrassed!

"Argh," thought Susan, "'I guess I should wait a little with **those three little words**. But I'm afraid I have **fallen for** John really quickly, and I'm already **head over heels in love!**"
