# Episode #9 of 10 - Brunch

Susan was lying on the floor, disoriented by the fall. Luckily, she managed to stand up on her own.

"Are you OK?" asked a worried voice. "I'm John, I'm new here."

"Oh, yes, I'm fine," she replied. "I guess I'm just starvingâ€”I haven't had anything to eat this morning."

"Well, let me take you for **brunch** at our **canteen**. What would you like to eat?"

"Eggs! I love eggs! Some **scrambled eggs**... or **sunny-side up**... or even **soft-boiled eggs!**"

"Well, I'd love to get you some eggs, but I'm afraid they've only got sandwiches. And only healthy ones for that matter! **Whole-grain bread** with **lettuce** and low-fat **spread** instead of butter."

"Oh, come on, I almost died today! I don't want healthy food! Look, they also have muffins! I want a **cranberry** muffin, a **raspberry** muffin, and a **chocolate** chip one!"

## Key words

A **brunch** is a meal between breakfast and lunch. The name comes from the combination of the two words: br(eakfast) + (l)unch.

A **canteen** is like a restaurant at an office.

**Soft-boiled eggs** are, well, boiled, and the yellow part is still soft. The opposite are **hard-boiled eggs**.

**Whole-grain bread** is the healthy, "brown" bread that contains whole grains.

A **spread** is soft food that you put on butter, etc. It's similar to butter.

**Chocolate chips** are little pieces of chocolate. Yum!

**Scrambled eggs** are eggs cooked with their yellow and white parts mixed together.

An egg that is **sunny-side** up is fried on one side only. It looks like the sun! :)

**Lettuce** is the green vegetable with leaves that often comes in sandwiches. It's also good for salads!

A **cranberry** is a small red fruit that is sour.

A **raspberry** is a small, soft, red fruit that is sweet.

## Bonus words

If you are **disoriented**, you don't know what's happening around you.

If you are **starving**, you are very hungry.

Hmm, John seems like such a nice guy. And Susan is single... Join us tomorrow for the last episode to find out what happens between them!
