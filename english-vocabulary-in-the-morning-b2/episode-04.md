# Episode #4 of 10 - Clothes

Frustrated by the bad coffee and the flooded bathroom, Susan decided to get dressed. She opened her **wardrobe** and faced the typical womanly problem.

"Nothing to wear, as usual," she thought.

OK, first things first. The underwear. A **spotted** bra and some lovely **knickers** with **lace** and a ribbon. Sweet and girly!

Now, for the top—the **round neck** blouse, the **V-neck blouse**, or the **turtleneck** sweater?

And for the bottom, a **flared** skirt, a frilled **skirt**, or a **pencil** one? The flared skirt **fits** her really well, but it doesn't **go with** any of the tops!

Choices, choices. Men have it so much easier!

## Key words

A **wardrobe** is the piece of furniture in your house where you keep clothes. The American word is a **closet**.

A **round neck** blouse has a top that is round (= looks like a circle).

A **V-neck blouse** has a top that looks like the letter V.

A **turtleneck** sweater has a high top to keep your neck warm.

A **flared** skirt has a lot of material at the bottom; it looks like the letter A.

If clothes **fit** you, they are a good size—not too big, not too small.

If clothes **go with** other clothes, they look good together. Black goes with everything. Red does not go with blue!

**Spotted** clothes have little spots (= circles) on them.

**Knickers** are a piece of underwear under a woman's jeans or skirt. **Lace** is a delicate material with little holes in it. In the picture you can see knickers with black lace.

A **frilled** skirt has pieces of shorter material on it. Little girls like frills!

A **pencil** skirt is slim and straight.

## Bonus words

**First things first**: A saying—you should do the most important things first and others later.

Knickers with lace and a **ribbon**. (= a long piece of cloth tied as decoration. You can see it in the picture of the knickers)

And how about accessories? Come back tomorrow morning to find out!
