# Episode #2 of 10 - The Coffee

Susan had overslept and ran, panicked, into the kitchen.

"There's nothing like a mug of **freshly ground coffee** to wake you up," she thought. She took some **coffee beans** from the cupboard and wanted to pour them into the **coffee grinder** — but instead she spilled them all over the kitchen!

"Butterfingers!" she shouted at herself.

She **ground** the coffee and then put it into the **coffeemaker**. She pressed the button and waited… and waited… and waited. Nothing happened! The coffeemaker was broken! She had to make some instant coffee — yuck!

She made it, and then wanted to add milk. **Skim milk** — she was on a diet. She opened the fridge and... oh no! No skim milk! Not even **full-fat milk**! Imagine what she found. Only **half and half**! The day had just started, and it had already gone from bad to worse!

## Key words

When coffee is collected from coffee plants, it comes in **beans** — big oval seeds.

When you **grind** coffee, you change its form from beans to a powder. It's an irregular verb: grind-ground-ground.

The machine you use to grind coffee is a **coffee grinder**.

When you have just ground your coffee, the result is **freshly ground coffee**. It smells great!

Then you put the powder into a machine called a **coffeemaker**. This machine makes coffee.

Many people like to add milk to their coffee. **Skim milk** has no fat, as opposed to normal **full-fat milk**, which has 3.2% fat. In between, we have **semi-skim milk** (reduced fat).

In Britain, it is quite popular to add half and half. This is half milk, half cream, and has about 15% fat. Cats love it!
