# Episode #5 of 10 - Accessories

OK, so the clothes are ready, but what about accessories? Susan went to her **chest of drawers** to look for the right extras. She thought to herself:

For my head, a **Stetson hat**, like a cowboy? Or a classic **fedora hat**? Definitely not a **top hat**—I'm not a magician!

Should I wear **stilettos** to look sexier? **Boots** to be warmer? Or **trainers**? They're more comfortable?

And now the bag. A **briefcase** for all my work documents? And a classy **clutch** bag to hold in my other hand? But the doctor told me a **backpack** is better for my back.

Now, the jewelry. Do **hairpins** count as jewelry? Probably not—but they will keep my hair neat and tidy.

Oh, what a nice **bracelet**! It will look so pretty on my wrist! And you know what else would look great? A diamond ring! I wish I had a diamond ring!

This reminded Susan that she is single...and she's already late!
