# Episode #1 of 10 - The Bed

	Hello! I am very happy you have signed up for this course—thank you! I
	believe it will help you become a more confident speaker of English.

	Each lesson is an episode from a story. The story follows the adventures
	of Susan, a young woman, during one of the mornings of her life—a
	morning that goes particularly badly.

	Each episode has around seven key words (scientists have proven that
	this is the number of new things we can learn at a time) connected with
	the topic of morning vocabulary, and also a few bonus words, all on the
	B2 level.

	Have fun learning!

Susan was sleeping in her bed. She had beautiful dreams of flowers, butterflies, and handsome men. But at 7 am, the alarm clock **went off**.

"Oh no"' she thought and started frantically looking for it on the **nightstand**.

She finally found the alarm clock but accidentally knocked it over. It fell on the floor and shattered to pieces.

"Oh well, now I can **sleep in** every day," she thought.

She was considering staying in bed... under the warm "duvet"... on the soft **pillow** and the smooth **bed sheet**. The idea was so tempting that she drifted off and almost **overslept**.

"Oh no," she shouted when she woke up. It was 8 am, and she started work at 9! She had to hurry!

She jumped out of bed and ran to the kitchen.

## Key words

If an alarm clock **goes off**, it starts ringing in the morning.

A **nightstand** is a small table next to your bed. You can keep a lamp and an alarm clock there.

If you **sleep in**, you sleep longer than usual, especially on the weekend.

A **duvet** is something you cover yourself with in bed. It's like a blanket, but thicker and warmer.

A **pillow** is the soft thing you put your head on when you sleep.

The **bed sheet** is the thin piece of fabric you put on your bed when you sleep.

If you **oversleep**, you sleep longer than you intended to, and you might be late for work or school.

## Bonus words

"Oh no," she thought and started **frantically** looking for it on the nightstand.(= in a worried, upset way)

She finally found the alarm clock but accidentally **knocked it over**. (= pushed it, and it fell down)

It fell on the floor and **shattered to pieces**. (= broke into small pieces)

The idea was so **tempting** (= attractive) that she **drifted off**. (= fell asleep)


Tomorrow we will learn what happened in the kitchen! And it won't be good....
