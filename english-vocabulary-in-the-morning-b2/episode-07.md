# Episode #7 of 10 - Public Transport

Having wrecked the car, Susan had to come up with another way of getting to work. Luckily, there was a **bus stop** nearby.

Susan hated **commuting** to work by bus. She hated waiting in the cold at the bus stop, all the sweaty people, the crowd, the expensive **fares**. Only the **double-deckers** in London were nice—so romantic and retro. But she had no choice now. Her boss would kill her!

The bus finally arrived. She **got on** the bus and—to her surprise—realized that she was the only passenger!

"Good," she thought, "I can have the **aisle seat**, and my bag can have the **window seat** with no pangs of conscience that I am blocking two seats!"

She sat down and enjoyed the trip. But after 20 minutes, the bus suddenly stopped. Susan looked out the window—there was an open **manhole** in the middle of the road! And no workmen in sight!

Luckily, she was already close to her office, so she decided to **get off** the bus and run the rest of the way.

"I wonder if this counts as my morning jog..."

## Key words

A **bus stop** is a place where buses stop to pick up passengers.

If you **commute**, you travel to work every day. People who do it are called commuters. Most of us are commuters.

The **fare** is the money you have to pay to travel on public transport.

A **double-decker** is a bus that has two levels. They are typical in London.

When you want to use a bus, you **get on** the bus. After the trip, you **get off** the bus.

There are two kinds of seats on buses, planes, etc. The **window seat** is, well, closer to the window. The **aisle seat** is closer to the space between the seats on both sides of the bus/plane.

A **manhole** is a hole in the road, with a metal top, that leads to cables, pipes, or the **sewage** system (= the system of getting dirty water away).

## Bonus words

Susan had to **come up with** another way of getting to work. (= have a new idea)

I can have the aisle seat, and my bag can have the window seat with no **pangs of conscience** that I am blocking two seats! (= a feeling that you're doing something bad)

There were no workmen **in sight!** (= she couldn't see them)

I wonder if this counts as **my morning jog**. (= when you go running in the morning to keep fit and healthy)

Finally, the end of her problems! Everything has to go well when she gets to the office, right?
