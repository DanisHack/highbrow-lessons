# Episode #3 of 10 - The Bathroom

Frustrated by the coffee disaster, Susan ran into the bathroom. She always started the day by weighing herself on the bathroom **scale**. She stepped on the scaleâ€”oh no, 1 kilo more than yesterday! She was sure it was because of the half and half in the coffee!

She looked at the **faucet**. It was **leaking**.

Oh! "I'll have to call the **plumber** later on," she thought.

She opened the **tap** and let the water fill the **bathtub**.

Then she tried to turn off the tap, but it got stuck! It wouldn't work. The bath **overflowed**, and water **gushed out** into the whole bathroom!

Oh no! It's a really bad day!

## Key words

The **scale** is the machine to check how heavy you are.

The **faucet**, or the tap, is the thing on your bath or washbasin that controls how much water is coming out.

If your faucet is **leaking**, it means there is water coming out when there should be no water!

A **plumber** is the specialist who can repair things in your bathroom and toilet.

A **bathtub** is the big container where you can sit and have a bath.

If a bath **overflows**, there is too much water and it gets out onto the bathroom floor.

If water **gushes out**, a lot of water comes out very fast.

## Bonus words

She always started the day by **weighing** herself on the bathroom scale. (= checking how heavy she was)

She tried to **turn off** the tap (= to stop the water), but it **got stuck** (= she couldn't move it).

Maybe getting dressed will be easier at least? Find out tomorrow!
