# Episode #8 of 10 - The Office

All sweaty and out of breath, Susan finally reached her workplace. To be honest, she really hated it—the **open-plan space** without even **cubicles**, just low **partitions** between her and her **colleagues**.

She looked around her desk, thinking about which office supplies she will need today. A **hole punch**, check. A **stapler**, check. A **pencil sharpener**, check. All in place!

It was a bit sad, though, that her **potted** plant had **wilted** over the weekend.

She went to the **filing cabinet** and found the **files** she needed for today. Another **mundane**, **run-of-the-mill** day was ahead of her.

She came back to her desk and decided to do something fun for a change—something that would cheer her up. And she had the perfect idea! She could spin around in her **swivel chair**! Like on a carousel! She pushed herself away from the desk, but the chair, instead of turning round, just fell down onto the floor! And she went down with it!

## Key words

An **open-plan space** is an office without separate rooms.

**Cubicles** are small areas in a room separated by thin walls or curtains.

**Partitions** are walls or screens separating one area from another.

A **colleague** is someone you work with. Another word is **co-worker**. Be careful: in some languages, a similar word means “a friend.” But a colleague does not have to be your friend.

A **potted plant** is a plant that grows in your house, not in a garden. It grows in a container called a pot.

If a plant **wilts**, it starts to die. You have to water it fast!

A **file** is a set of papers with information. Usually boring.

**Mundane** and run-of-the-mill both mean boring and repetitive.

A **hole punch** is a piece of office equipment for making little holes in paper.

A **stapler** is a piece of office equipment for attaching pieces of paper together.

A **pencil sharpener** is a piece of office equipment to make your pencil sharp.

A **filing cabinet** is a piece of office furniture where you can keep your documents.

A **swivel chair** is a chair that can turn around.

## Bonus words

A **check** is a mark you make, like a tick, to show everything is OK.

When somebody is sad, you can do something funny to **cheer** them **up** and make them smile again.

A **carousel**, or a **merry-go-round**, is an attraction in a theme park where children sit on plastic animals, and the animals go round in a circle.
