# Episode #6 of 10 - Homonyms and Homophones

Whether you see someone getting berated on social media for saying "your not very nice" or read a news story about a school printing "good luck out their!" in their graduation program, homonyms and homophones are all over the place.

A "homonym" is defined as: "each of two or more words having the same spelling but different meanings and origins (e.g., pole and pole); a homograph" and "each of two words having the same pronunciation but different meanings, origins, or spelling (e.g., to, too, and two); a homophone."

Knowing which word to use in what situation is another critical skill that a good writer has perfected. The best way to avoid using the wrong word is to learn the most common homophones and memorize their correct usage.

Here are some of the most commonly confused words that you should know how to correctly use:
