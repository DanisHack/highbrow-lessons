# Episode #3 of 10 - Sentence Structure

You've got your building blocks at the readyâ€”now let's learn how to lay them out in order to build something meaningful.

This chart helps with the basic parts of speech:

There are 4 basic types of sentences:

- Declarative sentence: A statement | I enjoy driving quickly.
- Imperative sentence: A command | Drive faster.
- Interrogative sentence: A question | Why aren't you driving faster?
- Exclamatory sentence: A sentence that expresses great emotion | Slow down!

All sentences have a subject and a predicate. That is, all sentences have someone or something (subject) and what it is they're doing (predicate). There's a star and there's action.

There's a lot more to basic grammar and sentence structure but not nearly enough space or time to go over it. Mastering these rules is a great first step, but I encourage you to explore English grammar on your own.
