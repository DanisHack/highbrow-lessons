This course is for beginner developers who have an interest in developing iOS apps with Swift. Through the next 10 awesome emails, you’ll learn the basic components of Swift, the language used to build iOS and macOS apps. We’ll teach you core concepts through a series of analogies. Since these are digested through emails, this course is not intended to get you writing full-fledged programs with functional code, but rather, to introduce the concepts that will allow you to confidently dive nose first into learning iOS development and eventually build your own custom apps.
