	"The secret to financial security is not to have more money, but having more control over the money we presently have." - Auliq-Ice, author

One of the reasons that tracking your spending is emphasized is that it gives you a better starting point for planning your spending. Planning your spending is often referred to as creating a budget. My preference is to refer to it as a money plan, because there are fewer negative connotations. Budgets can feel restrictive, whereas a money plan puts the control back in your hands.

## How to Create a Money Plan

Creating a money plan that you follow on a monthly basis is usually easiest because it aligns with your monthly pay. It’s also important to look ahead by at least a few months to help take into account irregular expenses.

1. **Pay yourself first**. As soon as your paycheck hits your account, take a percentage (1-10%) of it and put it straight into savings. You can set this up as an automated payment taken monthly.
2. **Calculate the essentials**. What money do you need to put aside for your basic living costs? Examples: rent/mortgage and bills (electricity, gas, internet).
3. **Calculate the basics**. What money do you need to put aside for groceries and gas/commuting costs? Examples: Food shopping, clothes to replace ones that are no longer wearable.
4. **Estimate big expenses for the year**. What one-off expenses do you pay every year? Examples: Car insurance, car taxes, commuter season ticket, holidays, weddings.

## 70/20/10

If the suggested money plan above feels too complicated, you could use a simpler method: 70/20/10. 70% of your income covers your essentials and basic living costs, 20% of your income covers anything discretionary (e.g., eating out, going to the movies), and then 10% goes towards your savings goals.

## Optimizing Every Month

One of the benefits of tracking your expenses is that you can track alongside your spending plan. You don’t have to be rigid; flexibility at the beginning is key for finding what works for you. As entrepreneur Tim Ferriss says, "The decent method you follow is better than the perfect method you quit."

## Write It Down

Whichever approach you choose, the key is to write it down. [Research shows](http://www.goalband.co.uk/the-research.html) that you’re more likely to stick to a plan when it is written down.

**In summary**, create a basic money plan to start diverting your income toward your goals.
