# Episode #9 of 10 - Developing a Supportive Community

![](episode-01.jpg)

In our last lesson, we learned some tools for planning ahead, which is a major factor in being successful with weight management. Another factor in being successful is having long-term support.

In today’s lesson, we will focus on developing the support you need to stick with your goals and lifestyle changes. By the end of the lesson, you will select an individual in your life that you can go to for support while you embark on your weight management journey.

A huge part of being successful in managing your weight—and with any goal in general—is having support. A [study](http://www.dominican.edu/dominicannews/study-highlights-strategies-for-achieving-goals) done by psychology professor Dr. Matthews at the Dominican University of California measured the likelihood of successfully achieving a goal with and without the support of a friend. Her research found that people who updated their friend on their progress once a week had a 70% chance of achieving their goal! People who kept their goal to themselves only reached their goal 35% of the time.

It’s important that you have at least one person that you can talk to about your weight management journey. Here’s a simple framework that you can use to ask for the support of a friend or family member:

*I’m setting a goal of managing my weight. In the next month I am going to log my food and start tracking my weight. I would love your support! Would you be willing to _______ (walk with me, help me plan a healthy grocery list, encourage me, check in on me via text) once a week? It would mean a lot to me.*

If you don’t have someone you feel comfortable asking, you can look at other resources: hiring a [health coach](http://www.emergehealthcoaching.com/), talking to a counselor (especially helpful if you feel your weight is related to underlying emotional issues), or finding a support group. One popular, nationwide support group is [Overeaters Anonymous](https://oa.org/). There are also groups dedicated to people who enjoy a similar activity and want to get to know other like-minded people on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/).

Your challenge today is to talk to at least one person or commit to doing one thing that can allow you to find a friend to gain support from. It’s scientifically proven to be effective in keeping you on track with your goals!

Cheers to your health, Aimee
